# LYT (Linking Your Thinking) Methodology Reference

## Core Principles

### 1. Linking IS Thinking
Creating a link between two notes forces mental conversation: "How are these notes related, in what way, and why?" This generates **Thought Collisions** that enrich understanding.

### 2. MOCs (Maps of Content)
- **Non-destructive**: A note can be in multiple MOCs
- **Non-exclusive**: Not forced into single category
- **Evolutionary**: MOCs evolve through stages as thinking develops

### 3. Idea Emergence
New ideas emerge from unexpected connections between notes. The goal is creating conditions for **second-order effects** (insights from collisions), not just first-order (storage/retrieval).

### 4. Compound Effect
Quality notes + consistency + time = RADICAL VALUE CREATED
Notes are long-term assets that appreciate through:
- Iterative development
- Reuse in multiple contexts
- Network effects (new notes connecting to old)

### 5. Note-MAKING vs Note-TAKING
- **Note-taking**: Passive, consuming, highlighting others' ideas
- **Note-making**: Active, developing YOUR own thinking

## MOC Evolution Stages

### Stage 1: List
- **Purpose**: Simple reunion of related notes
- **Time to create**: 10 minutes
- **Structure**: Basic list of links with 1-paragraph intro
- **Use when**: You have 7-10+ notes on a theme

### Stage 2: Workbench
- **Purpose**: Active development of theme
- **Evolution time**: 2-4 weeks of active work
- **Structure**: Grouped links + comments + your thinking
- **Use when**: Actively working on project/theme

### Stage 3: Hub
- **Purpose**: Mature, reliable reference
- **Evolution time**: 2-6 months of refinement
- **Structure**: Polished intro + well-organized sections + synthesis
- **Use when**: Theme has matured and stabilized

## Key Concepts

### Atomic Notes
- **One note = One idea**
- Indivisible, complete thought
- Reusable in multiple contexts
- Enables precise linking

### Evergreen Notes
- Concepts you refine perpetually
- Track evolution of understanding over time
- Document how thinking changes

### Home Note
- **"Reorientation device"**
- Dashboard with 3-7 active Efforts (projects)
- Links to main MOCs
- Should grant immediate clarity (<10 seconds)

### Efforts
- Active projects (3-7 max)
- Have clear next actions
- Archived when complete
- Cycle regularly (don't let stagnate)

## System Architecture

```
HOME (Dashboard)
├─ Efforts (3-7 active projects)
├─ MOCs (Flexible contextual structures)
│  ├─ Concept MOCs (themes)
│  ├─ Project MOCs (active work)
│  ├─ Person MOCs (influences)
│  └─ Time MOCs (chronological)
└─ Atomic Notes (Building blocks)
   ├─ Evergreens (timeless insights)
   ├─ Literature Notes (from sources)
   └─ Fleeting Notes (quick captures)
```

## Best Practices

### Linking
- Minimum 2-3 links per note
- Explain WHY you're linking (add context)
- Create bidirectional links when appropriate
- Use MOCs for contextual grouping

### Folder Structure
- **Keep minimal**: ACE (ATLAS, CALENDAR, EXTRAS)
- Folders are for system, not thinking
- Links and MOCs do the organizing

### Avoid
- ❌ Collector's Fallacy (collecting ≠ knowing)
- ❌ Perfectionism (progress > perfection)
- ❌ Over-categorization (let structure emerge)
- ❌ Rigid hierarchies (prevents cross-domain insights)
- ❌ Tags instead of links (tags are flat, links are contextual)

### Embrace
- ✅ Curiosity over efficiency
- ✅ Following rabbit holes
- ✅ Sharing imperfect work
- ✅ Emergent structure
- ✅ Cross-domain connections
- ✅ Plain text + local-first (future-proofing)

## Metrics That Matter

- **Quality over Quantity**: Better 3 developed notes than 30 collected
- **Ratio**: Atomic notes : Source notes = 3:1 target
- **Links per note**: 3-5+ average
- **Orphan notes**: Minimize (no links in/out)
- **Hub notes**: 10+ links indicate central concepts
- **Time**: 80% developing, 20% collecting

---

## When to Use MOCs vs Links

**Direct Links:**
- Clear, obvious relationship between two notes
- Causal, definitional, or example relationship
- Navigation between related concepts

**MOCs:**
- 7-10+ notes on same theme
- Need contextual organization
- Active project workbench
- Theme requires sub-grouping
- Mature topic needing synthesis

---

## Common Pitfalls

1. **Creating MOCs too early** (wait for 7-10 notes)
2. **Never evolving Stage 1 to Stage 2** (MOCs should grow)
3. **Too many Efforts** (>7 = diluted focus)
4. **Collecting without developing** (Collector's Fallacy)
5. **Perfectionism preventing sharing** (70% is enough)
6. **Siloed thinking** (never connecting domains)
7. **Serving the system** (should serve you, not vice versa)

## Quick Decision Framework

**Should I create a link?**
→ Can these notes "illuminate each other"? → Yes = Link

**Should I create a MOC?**
→ Do I have 7-10+ related notes? → Yes = MOC Stage 1

**Should I evolve this MOC?**
→ Am I actively working this theme? → Yes = Evolve to Stage 2

**Is this note atomic?**
→ Can it be broken into 2+ distinct ideas? → Yes = Split it

**Is this an Evergreen?**
→ Will I refine this concept for years? → Yes = Mark as Evergreen
