# AIDA Framework - Proven Copywriting Formula

Product/Service: $ARGUMENTS

I need you to write copy using the AIDA framework (Attention, Interest, Desire, Action) - one of the most proven copywriting formulas in marketing history.

## AIDA Structure:

### A - ATTENTION (Headline/Hook)
Create 5 headline variations that:
- Stop the scroll immediately
- Speak to a specific pain or desire
- Use power words that trigger emotion
- Create curiosity gap
- Maximum 10 words

Examples patterns:
- "How to [achieve desire] without [pain point]"
- "[Number] [target audience] are switching to [solution]"
- "The [surprising thing] that [unexpected result]"
- "Warning: [problem] is costing you [loss]"

### I - INTEREST (Lead/Story)
Build interest with:
- Relatable problem scenario
- Surprising statistic or fact
- Brief story that resonates
- Question that makes them think
- Challenge their current beliefs

Keep them reading by:
- Making it about THEM, not you
- Using "you" language
- Being specific, not generic
- Adding sensory details
- Creating mental images

### D - DESIRE (Benefits/Transformation)
Transform features into emotional benefits:

**Feature → Benefit → Emotion**
- What it is → What it does → How they feel

Paint the transformation:
- Before state (current pain)
- After state (desired outcome)
- Bridge (your solution)

Use desire amplifiers:
- Social proof (testimonials, numbers)
- Authority (credentials, awards)
- Scarcity (limited time/quantity)
- Exclusivity (not for everyone)
- Risk reversal (guarantees)

Stack multiple benefits:
1. Primary benefit (main problem solved)
2. Secondary benefits (additional wins)
3. Emotional benefits (confidence, peace)
4. Social benefits (status, belonging)

### A - ACTION (Call-to-Action)
Create urgency without being pushy:

**CTA Formula:**
- Clear directive verb
- Specific value statement
- Urgency/scarcity element
- Risk removal

Examples:
- "Start your transformation today - 30-day guarantee"
- "Claim your spot before prices increase Friday"
- "Get instant access - Cancel anytime"

## Output Format:

### Version 1: Short Form (Social Media Ad)
- 50-100 words
- Single focused message
- One clear CTA

### Version 2: Medium Form (Email)
- 150-250 words
- Multiple benefit points
- Stronger story element

### Version 3: Long Form (Landing Page)
- 300-500 words
- Complete transformation story
- Multiple proof elements
- FAQ objection handling

## Psychological Principles to Apply:
- Loss aversion (what they'll miss)
- Social proof (others are doing it)
- Authority (why trust you)
- Reciprocity (give value first)
- Consistency (small yes → big yes)
- Liking (be relatable)

Make the copy flow naturally from attention to action, with each section building on the previous one. The reader should feel like buying is their idea, not yours.
