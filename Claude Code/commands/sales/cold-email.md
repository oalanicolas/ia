# Cold Email That Gets Responses - Proven Template

To: $1
Offer: $2

Write cold emails that actually get responses using this battle-tested framework from top sales teams.

## The 3-Step Formula: Research → Personalize → Value

### EMAIL STRUCTURE

#### Subject Line (5-7 words max)
Create 3 variations using these patterns:
- Question about their specific situation
- Their company + intriguing statement
- Mutual connection or reference
- Recent trigger event (news, funding, hire)
- NOT: "Quick question" or "Intro"

Examples:
- "Saw your LinkedIn post about [topic]"
- "[Company] + [specific challenge they face]"
- "[Mutual connection] suggested we connect"
- "Congrats on [recent achievement]"

#### Opening Line (1 sentence)
Start with one of these:
- Genuine compliment about their work
- Reference to their content/post/article
- Mention of mutual connection
- Observation about their company
- Industry insight they'd care about

NEVER start with:
- "I hope this email finds you well"
- "My name is..."
- "I'm reaching out because..."

#### The Hook (1-2 sentences)
Create relevance immediately:
- "Noticed you're [specific observation about their business]"
- "Your recent [action] suggests [insight]"
- "Other [similar companies] tell me [relevant challenge]"
- "Your team's focus on [goal] reminded me of..."

#### Value Prop (2-3 sentences)
What's in it for THEM:
- Specific result you've achieved for similar company
- Insight they likely don't know
- Resource that solves their specific problem
- Introduction that would benefit them
- Opportunity they might miss

Format: "We helped [similar company] achieve [specific result] by [brief how]"

#### Social Proof (1 sentence)
Brief credibility builder:
- Name drop relevant client
- Mention specific metric
- Reference relevant experience
- Share quick win

Keep it relevant to THEIR industry/size/challenge

#### Clear CTA (1 sentence)
One specific, low-friction ask:
- 15-minute call next week?
- Can I send you a 2-minute video?
- Worth a quick chat?
- Mind if I send over some ideas?
- Would you be the right person to speak with?

NOT: Multiple options or vague asks

#### Sign-off
Professional but human:
- Best,
- Cheers,
- Thanks,
- [Your name]

#### P.S. Line (Optional but powerful)
Add value or urgency:
- "P.S. [Relevant resource] you might find useful: [link]"
- "P.S. Happy to share how [competitor] is handling this"
- "P.S. Running a special promotion through [date]"

### PSYCHOLOGICAL PRINCIPLES

#### Pattern Interrupts
- Start differently than 99% of cold emails
- Use unexpected honesty
- Break formal business speak
- Add appropriate humor

#### The 3 C's
1. **Clear**: One idea per email
2. **Concise**: Under 150 words
3. **Compelling**: Every line earns the next

#### Value Stack
Layer multiple subtle value points:
- Value in subject (curiosity)
- Value in opening (compliment/insight)
- Value in body (solution/result)
- Value in P.S. (resource/tip)

### FOLLOW-UP SEQUENCE

#### Email 2 (3 days later)
- Reply to original
- Add new value/insight
- Different angle
- Shorter than first

#### Email 3 (5 days later)
- Break-up email
- "Should I close your file?"
- Final value share
- Clear yes/no

### A/B TEST ELEMENTS
- Subject lines
- Opening lines
- CTA types
- Email length
- Formal vs casual tone
- Data/metrics vs stories

### METRICS TO TRACK
- Open rate (aim for 40%+)
- Response rate (aim for 15%+)
- Positive response rate (aim for 8%+)
- Meeting booked rate (aim for 5%+)

## DO's and DON'Ts

### DO:
- Research for 2 minutes per prospect
- Write like a human talks
- Make it about them
- Keep paragraphs to 2 lines
- Test everything

### DON'T:
- Use corporate jargon
- Talk about your company first
- Send walls of text
- Use multiple CTAs
- Sound desperate

Create 2 versions: one more formal, one more casual. Make it impossible to ignore without being annoying.
