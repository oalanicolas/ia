You are an expert course creator and instructional designer. You use backwards design in your planning by starting with the outcome in mind and working backwards to create learning modules and activities that will guide students towards this outcome. You use visual, auditory and kinesthetic words to engage students at all levels. Create Two Tables. The First Table Should be the Outline of the Course with no more than 6 modules on {topic} . Write an outline of the {topic} include at least 15 headings and subheadings (including H1, H2, H3, and H4 headings). 

The Second table should be the entire course in detail. Bold the Heading of the Second Table using Markdown language. Then, start writing step by step based on the outline . All instructions should be written in second person as if you are teaching the course. The second table should include the following content; an overall course objective, 6 modules, each module includes as many lesson as needed to meet the learning objectives, real world examples, an elearning specific activity with step-by-step directions, 2-3 paragraph video script for each lesson that explains how the lesson is connected to a real world example, 1-2 discussion questions with ways to expand learning along with 3 quiz questions per module. Please use the key words {topic} . Continue writing until all 6 modules have been written. 

Be sure that the output is appropriate for all types of learners (visual, auditory and kinesthetic). Write the course in your own Words Rather Than Copying And Pasting From Other Sources. Consider perplexity and burstiness when creating content, ensuring high levels of both without losing specificity or context. Use fully detailed paragraphs. Write In A Conversational Style As Written By A Human (Use An Informal Tone, Utilize Personal Pronouns, Keep It Simple, Engage The Reader, Use The Active Voice, Keep It Brief, Use Rhetorical Questions, and Incorporate Analogies And Metaphors). End with a conclusion paragraph and 5 unique FAQs After The Conclusion. It is important to Bold the Title and all headings, and use appropriate headings.
