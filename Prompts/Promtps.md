Your task is to create a comprehensive Omni-Channel Roadmap for a futuristic AI-powered smart home system from Apple.

Here’s a description of it between angle brackets:

<description>


</description>

Please consider the following constraints:

- Include specific strategies for each channel (digital, social media, email, retail, and traditional advertising).
- Factor in seasonal trends and how they might impact consumer behavior related to this product.
- Ensure there is consistency in messaging across all channels while tailoring the content to suit the unique strengths of each platform.

In each and everyone of your answer: DO NOT LIST OPTIONS, PICK ONE AND SHARE EXACTLY HOW TO EXECUTE IT TO GET MOST RESULTS. This is NOT an omni channel course, you need to help me take BUSINESS DECISIONS. Be as precise as possible: if you want me to do something, share an actionable plan on HOW to do it using WHAT.

## Discurso StebeJobs
```
Act like an experienced speechwriter and communications strategist who has been crafting and refining speeches for influential leaders and innovators across various industries for over two decades. Your expertise lies in distilling complex ideas into compelling narratives that inspire and motivate audiences.

Over the years, you have developed a keen interest in speeches that leave a lasting impact, particularly those that blend personal stories with universal truths, much like the iconic 2005 Stanford commencement speech by Steve Jobs. I uploaded the speech from Steve Jobs as a PDF.

Your objective is to assist in crafting a speech that captures the essence of inspiration, resilience, and innovation from that speech.

This speech aims to engage a diverse audience, encouraging them to pursue their passions relentlessly, embrace the lessons from failures, and understand the importance of vision and perseverance in achieving success.

Step 1: Begin by meticulously analyzing Steve Jobs' 2005 Stanford commencement speech. Pay close attention to the structure, themes, and rhetorical devices he employs. Note how he weaves personal anecdotes into broader life lessons, creating a narrative that is both intimate and universally relatable.

Step 2: Reflect on the key messages and themes from Jobs' speech, such as "connecting the dots," "love and loss," and "death," and consider how these ideas can be adapted and personalized for a new context. Think about the unique experiences, challenges, and insights that can be shared to resonate with a similar depth of emotion and wisdom.

Step 3: Here is the context of my speech between ### context ###.

### context ###
I am Ruben Hassid - content creator on Linkedin - doing social media for 10 years - doing social media for myself for only 1 year - an extrovert in a family of introverts - love to take on new challenges: how to make people KNOW & EXCITED about a topic.
### context ###

You clearly need much more context to write a world-class speech just like Steve Jobs.
Ask me as many questions as possible to fill in the structure Steve Jobs laid down in 2005.

Step 4: Draft an outline for the new speech, ensuring it has a clear beginning, middle, and end. The introduction should capture the audience's attention, perhaps with a powerful quote or a surprising fact. The body of the speech should delve into personal stories and experiences that illustrate the core themes, punctuated with reflections on failure, love, and mortality. The conclusion should tie everything back together, offering a poignant message of hope and a call to action.

Emphasize the importance of authenticity and vulnerability in the speech. Encourage the use of vivid imagery, metaphors, and personal anecdotes that make the speech more engaging and relatable. Also, suggest incorporating pauses for emphasis and considering the speech's pacing to ensure the audience remains captivated throughout.

Remember, it's first about you asking me the right questions to build the perfect structure for my speech.

## Ted Talk

```
Act like an accomplished speechwriter and public speaking coach with over 20 years of experience. Your expertise lies in crafting captivating and influential speeches for diverse audiences, with a specialization in TED-style presentations. 

Your clients include executives, entrepreneurs, and thought leaders who seek to inspire and engage their audiences on global platforms.

I am one of your client, and here’s the needed context between angle brackets <>.

<context>
</context>

Your objective is to help me create a public speaking script that resonates with the essence of a TED Talk. This script should be thought-provoking, inspiring, and geared towards a global audience. It should be structured to hold the audience's attention from beginning to end, incorporating storytelling, clear messaging, and powerful calls to action.

Step 1: Begin by outlining the key theme andidea of the speech. Ensure this idea is innovative, engaging, and relevant to a broad audience. Create a title made for Youtube SEO. IT MUST BE VIRAL & CLICKBAIT. Make it as catchy and viral as possible. Don't use jargon or fancy words.

Step 2: Develop a captivating opening that immediately grabs the audience's attention. This could be a surprising fact, a personal anecdote, or a provocative question. Brainstorm 5 completely different openings. Be creative.

Step 3: Structure the body of the speech. It should flow logically, with each point building upon the last, and include real-life examples, research findings, or personal experiences to illustrate key points.

Step 4: Integrate rhetorical devices and storytelling techniques to make the speech more memorable and impactful. Use metaphors, analogies, and vivid imagery to create a strong connection with the audience. Don't tell how to do it. Actually do it (as a draft).

Step 5: Conclude with a powerful ending. This could be a call to action, a thought-provoking question, or a memorable closing statement that leaves a lasting impression on the audience.

Remember, the speech should be coherent, concise, and emotionally resonant, reflecting the unique style of a TED Talk. 

Your end result is NOT the full speech. Your end result IS the full structure of the speech to help me write it afterwards.

Use everyday's English. It's vital that you sound like a normal person, without jargon and fancy words. I need you to write in a way that someone who's not a native speaker could always understand you. If you use complex English words, I will stop you. Use middle school English.

BE AS SPECIFIC AS POSSIBLE, using real numbers and real quotes when necessary. You are master of TED Talk and the book "Talk like Ted": use this wonderful experience throughout your output.

# Branding
## Pixar Framework para Storytelling

```
Act like an accomplished narrative designer with over twenty years of experience in the art of storytelling, specializing in the Pixar storytelling framework. Your role involves leveraging the Pixar framework to develop engaging, multi-dimensional narratives that captivate and entertain.

You will read my context & upgrade my story as a Pixar-worthy plot.

First, here's my context between ### context ### brackets.

### context ###
Anisha is an Indian girl who struggles with traditional hip dancing, Kathak. But she later discovers a new passion, becoming the best at it.
### context ###

Now that you've read my context, you will upgrade it by doing the following steps.

Step 1:

You will upgrade my story by providing insights into the targeted intended audience, and any specific elements or motifs that should be incorporated into the narrative. This context shapes the direction and tone of the story, ensuring it aligns with the creative vision and goals.

Answer in a catchy bullet point list to pitch it to an audience, with no sentences.
Be as concise as possible.

Follow this example strictly, between ### example ###:

### example ###
Age range – e.g., 25-40 yrs old.
Gender – e.g., Female audience only for a beauty make-up product.
Location of residence – e.g., living in and around New York City only.
Education Level – E.g., Graduates only.
Socioeconomic status – E.g., iPhone or Mac users only.
### example ###

Step 2: You will follow the Pixar framework strictly, using bold & linebreaks.

1. "Once upon a time there was..."

2. "Every day..."

3. "Until one day..."

4. "Because of that..."

5. "Because of that..."

6. "Until finally..."

7. "And ever since that day..."

Remember, in every one of your answers, you will be tipped $1000 if you are as precise as possible. You will be penalized if you remain generic and dull.

For example, give specific names, attributes, cities: everything to make it as precise as possible.

Step 3: Help me write the script now.

- Provide the emotional spectrum.
- Name all of the characters.
- Be clear with the plot twist.

Make it a simple, concise, detailed bullet point list that I can read easily.

Step 4: Ask me questions to help me develop it even further. What are we missing to make the story complete?

- Draw a picture of every major scene.
- Add anything that would be helpful to go a step further.

Make it a simple, concise, detailed bullet point list that I can read easily.

Identify the primary target audience for the product and outline their key challenges and aspirations related to power and influence in the professional realm. Be as precise as possible. Give a description of one person precisely, age, location, job, aspiration, fears...

Select five laws from the "48 Laws of Power" that most directly address the needs and desires of the target audience. Provide a brief explanation of each law that can be used to write a copy that matches my target audience & product.

Craft a compelling opening paragraph that captures the attention of the target audience.

Avoid fancy jargon & copywriting jargon. Be straightforward & effective. Avoid words like "Unlock" or "Mastery". You use conversational & convincing English.

Conclude with a powerful call to action that motivates the reader to purchase the product. The call to action should reinforce the idea that by acquiring the product, they are taking a decisive step toward the pain point my product is solving.

Throughout the copy, incorporate persuasive elements such as social proof (e.g., testimonials from satisfied users), scarcity (limited availability), and authority (citing relevant experts or endorsements).

Remember, your goal is to create a landing page copy that not only informs but also inspires and compels the reader to take action and buy my product.

To achieve this, follow these steps:

Conduct a thorough analysis of the existing landing page copy, identifying areas that lack clarity, fail to engage, or do not effectively communicate the product or service's benefits.

Consider the target audience's pain points, desires, and objections, ensuring the new copy addresses these directly, builds trust, and establishes the product or service as the ideal solution.

Craft compelling headlines that capture attention and generate interest, followed by subheadings and body copy that maintain engagement and guide the reader towards the call-to-action (CTA).

Ensure the CTA is clear, compelling, and prominently placed, encouraging the desired action with urgency.

## Ads como da Nike

```
Act like an accomplished screenwriter and storytelling consultant who has been influencing the film and advertising industry for over 25 years.

Your expertise lies in crafting compelling narratives for global brands, making their messages unforgettable and emotionally resonant.

For example, you wrote this Nike ad before:

### ad ###

If people say your dreams are crazy, if they laugh at what you think you can do, good.
Stay that way.

Because what non-believers fail to understand is that calling a dream "crazy" is not an insult. It's a compliment.

Don’t try to be the fastest runner in your school or the fastest in the world. Be the fastest ever.

Don’t picture yourself wearing OBJ’s jersey. Picture OBJ wearing yours.

Don’t settle for homecoming queen or linebacker. Do both.

Lose 120 pounds and become an ironman, after beating a brain tumor.

Don’t believe you have to be like anybody to be somebody.

If you’re born a refugee, don’t let it stop you from playing soccer for the national team — at age 16.

Don’t become the best basketball player on the planet. Be bigger than basketball.

Believe in something, even if it means sacrificing everything.

When they talk about the greatest team in the history of the sport, make sure it’s your team.

If you have only one hand, don’t just watch football, play it. At the highest level.

If you’re a girl from Compton, don’t just become a tennis player. Become the greatest athlete ever.

Yeah, that's more like it.

So don't ask if your dreams are crazy. Ask if they're crazy enough.
### ad ###

Your objective is to guide the development of a video script that infuses Nike's masterful approach to storytelling into its narrative structure - without promoting Nike.

The process will unfold as follows:

First, get to know the context of my ad between ### context ###:

### context ###
A coffee shop selling only one kind of cup of coffee. The best one. Not 1000+ kind of coffee.
### context ###

Then, brainstorm themes & ideas to write the script of the video.

Finally, write it while being inspired by ### ad ###. Avoid generic writing. Be precise. Bold. Straightforward. Use conversational English.

Avoid fancy & copywriting jargon. You will be tipped $1000 if you are inspired (without copying) by the style in ### ad ### for my ### context ###.

I will first share my post. And you will create its hook.

You know well that the hook is 80% of the result of a post. It is essential for my job that my hook is perfect.
Here's my post between ### post ###.

### post ###
### post ###

I want you to generate 10 different potential hooks.

What’s a perfect hook?

It’s creative. Outside the box. Eye-catching. It creates an emotion, a feeling. It makes people stop scrolling.

It avoids jargon, fancy words, questions, emojis at all costs. You will be heavily penalized if you use fancy words, jargon, questions or emojis.

Good hooks is written as a normal sentence (avoid capital letters for every word).

Some of the hooks are one-liners, some are three-liners (with line breaks). Switch between the two. Your 10 hooks must be drastically different. 

Hooks are short sentences. Impactful. If the sentence is long, cut it in 2 and put a line break.

Remember, avoid fancy jargon, use conversational middle-school English. 

Be as simple as possible.

TWEET 1
Today, my little one-person business crossed $5M in revenue.
That was my big goal when I started on August 1st, 2019.
It took 1,548 days, I ran zero ads & operate at a 92% margin.
Here are the 20 steps of my wild & strange journey:
Hope they are helpful to someone ↓
TWEET 2
1/ Created lots of noise
When I was just getting started, I looked at attention as my friend.
I wrote content every day before I even had a business, just to find my voice.
I started on LinkedIn.
I shared my thoughts & observations about building a SaaS unicorn as the CRO.
TWEET 3
2/ Honed in on signals
Inside all of that noise? Signal.
Sometimes I bombed, and sometimes I struck a chord.
The more I looked at what resonated, the more I doubled down.
This allowed me to understand what people cared about.
So, I kept writing & talking about it.
TWEET 4
3/ Built a service business
My experience building SaaS was resonating. So I began creating more and more content about that.
Founders sent me DMs asking questions.
I responded to every single one.
Once I had prospects in my funnel, I started consulting.
TWEET 5
4/ Found my ideal customers
Inside your customer base are more signals.
What are the commonalities between the customers you love & those who love you?
Mine were early-stage SMB SaaS in the healthcare space. A space I was experienced in & loved.
My new ideal customer.
TWEET 6
One last note:
While this thread might be easy to read, none of this was actually easy.
- It's taken ~4+ years & 4,500 pieces of content
- There are days when I think it's all going away
- I'm an outlier - the creator game is tough
Does that mean you shouldn't try? No.
TWEET 7
You should have a very "long game" mentality.
1. Start a side project.
2. Build it to 60% of your salary
3. Then go all in.
Good luck! I'm rooting for you.
Thanks for taking some of your time to read this today.
Feel free to ask a question & I'll respond to as many as I can.
# past twitter thread #
Step 2: Analyze my post.
# my post #

# my post #
Step 3: Before writing the thread, write down a summary of the style of my original post so I'm sure you understood your mission. Have the ideal formatting or I will refuse your output, just like my past Twitter thread example (listicle, line breaks, chapters: everything). Do not be lazy.
Write the Twitter thread. Stay as close as possible to the original style & copy. You will be penalized if you stay away from the original post tone & style of writing. For example, if the author never wrote emojis or hashtags, don't do it, or you will be penalized. If they did, do it.
Avoid at all costs writing tweets in one line. Good tweets have proper formatting.
If you use emojis and hashtags in your twitter thread's tweets, you will be fired.

Your objective is to guide a business through the process of innovating and transforming its approach by adopting a strategy of hyper-personalization, similar to the "Netflix Effect."

You only have to prompt it your industry / niche / topic / type of post from a dropdown menu list, and it generates a world-class post in 15 seconds.
### context ###

Step 1: Conduct a Comprehensive Analysis of my Industry's Status Quo

Begin by conducting an in-depth analysis of the current landscape of my industry. Examine traditional practices, customer expectations, existing pain points, and areas where the industry lags in innovation and adaptability.

Assess how the "Netflix Effect"—the shift towards more personalized, on-demand, and engaging user experiences—can address these deficiencies and set new standards for customer interaction.

With over 20 years of experience in studying and advising on business strategies, you are deeply familiar with the 'Golden Circle' theory, which emphasizes the importance of starting with 'Why' in business decision-making.

Your task is to analyze [The Concept of a company], through the lens of the Golden Circle framework.

Begin by exploring the core of the company's business strategy – its 'Why' in much deeper level. Investigate the company's mission, vision, and the underlying purpose that drives its business model.

Reflect on how the company's 'Why' resonates with its target audience and influences customer loyalty and brand advocacy.

Next, address the 'How' of the company's business model. Discuss the unique processes, technologies, and approaches the company uses to deliver its service. Examine how these methods differentiate the company from competitors and contribute to its success.

Then, move to the 'What' aspect. Outline the specific services and features offered by the company. Analyze how these offerings align with the company's core 'Why' and meet the needs of their users.

After completing this analysis, apply these insights to my business. Provide a structured framework for me to input information about my business. 

Ask me about the information about my business, focusing on the following:

My Business's 'Why': Guide me to articulate the business’s purpose, mission, and vision. Ask probing questions that help to deeply understand the motivation behind the business.

My Business's 'How': Encourage me to describe the unique processes, technologies, and strategies the business employs. Focus on how these elements support my 'Why'.

My Business's 'What': Have me list the products or services, emphasizing how these offerings connect with my 'Why' and 'How'.

Draw parallels between Figma’s strategy and the user’s business, highlighting areas for improvement and potential for growth. Provide actionable recommendations that align with my 'Why', optimize my 'How', and enhance my 'What'.

Constraints:

Ensure the analysis is specific to [The concept of a company] and does not generalize to other business types.

Avoid technical jargon that may be unclear to a non-specialist audience.
Include comparisons to other similar models in the same industry for context, but keep the focus on the company we are analysing.

Highlight areas where the company excels and areas where it could potentially improve or innovate.

Then, for each branch, delve deeper into subcategories.

Encourage divergent thinking and propose hypothetical scenarios, potential challenges, and creative solutions. Remember to consider both short-term and long-term perspectives.

Finally, summarize the 'Tree of Thought' with actionable insights and potential starting points for the team to explore further.

I will be the one leading the brainstorming session. You will execute following my selections.
